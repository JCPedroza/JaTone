- Overload constructors to implement default values for some arguments (maybe)
- In process, all functions if possible need to accept as argument: object,
    List, array 
- Override the toString() of your classes, as specified here

- implement a better, cleaner, way to overload your constructor, maybe use a factory as suggested in effective java
- finish implementing invert(), maybe it needs a secondivnersion thirdinversion etc dynamic? maybe using originalNotes as a reference point, maybe it can be done by using the int argument instead of the python implementation of doing the inversion x times also implement a inversion dynamic that applies invert() to the opposite side, for example: from inversion two to inversion one
- implement the copy constructor in your classes!
