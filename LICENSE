You should feel to use Xochi, without restriction, for whatever purposes you want. You have our
blessing to use it, free of charge, and free of attribution, in whatever project you want, be it
open source, closed source, commercial, non-profit, whatever. We'd be very happy to have code
contributed to the library, and to have a mention in whatever project you use it for, but if either
of these aren't appropriate, you're under no obligation whatsoever to provide them.


We make no guarantees whatsoever about Xochi's reliability or suitability for any purpose. We're doing
the best we can to make it rock-solid, but if you choose to use it, you need to accept the possibility
that you may be entirely on your own, with no guarantee of support or recourse if it doesn't work out
the way you thought it would.
